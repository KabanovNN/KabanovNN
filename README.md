### Hello!
My name is Nikita Kabanov.

I noticed a tendency to structure information, analyze, look for correlations, generally work with data and optimize various points, make changes in life based on numbers, not only by intuition and feelings. I was interested in what kind of job it can be applied. I learned about Data Science and decided to study it. Currently I'm working on pet project 'Random_Card' and continue improving skill in SQL, Python and Statistics.
